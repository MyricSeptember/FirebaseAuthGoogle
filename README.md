# FirebaseAuthGoogle

This repository contains code for an article I wrote on Medium. It is a simple app that will teach you how to authenticate using Google Sign-in combined with Firebase to store registered users.

NB - Remember to add your google-services.json file in order for this app to work.

Here is the link to the medium article:
